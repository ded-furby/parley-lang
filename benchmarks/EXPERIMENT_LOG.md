# Agent efficiency experiment log

This is the durable memory for the fresh-context Parley agent benchmark.
Every material compiler, skill, harness, or diagnostic change gets a new
entry, a new immutable HTML report, and a commit before the next experiment.
Prior reports are never replaced or deleted.

## Acceptance target

Parley must preserve hidden-case correctness while reaching at least baseline
efficiency parity on the same declared task matrix and agent configuration.
The primary gate is median reported total tokens no higher than the better of
Python and Rust. Supporting gates are first-public-check success and median
elapsed time no worse than the better baseline. A result is directional until
confirmed with at least 10 replicates per task-language cell.

## 001 — Original pilot baseline

- Date: 2026-07-29
- Compiler: Parley 0.3.138, commit `98e613daeba50fdfe5c6e801e1365b920cb9ac4b`
- Agent: `gpt-5.6-sol`, medium reasoning, Codex CLI 0.142.5
- Matrix: 3 tasks × 3 languages × 2 replicates = 18 fresh sessions

| Language | Hidden success | First public pass | Median checks | Median tokens | Median seconds | Repair turns |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Parley | 6/6 | 1/6 | 3.0 | 174,124.0 | 55.4335 | 10 |
| Python | 6/6 | 5/6 | 1.0 | 49,837.5 | 23.5351 | 1 |
| Rust | 6/6 | 5/6 | 1.0 | 57,275.5 | 24.2891 | 1 |

### Observed causes

1. The complete shipped skill contributed a median 22,473 prompt characters,
   versus 1,202 for Python and 1,213 for Rust. The skill itself was 21,264
   characters.
2. Agents missed typed empty-list syntax, literal-brace escaping, promptless
   input syntax, and parenthesized expression calls.
3. Two bracket runs hit P901 after emitting a mutable list removal whose index
   also borrowed the list immutably.
4. One inventory run received cascading maybe/map diagnostics that obscured
   the first actionable type mistake.
5. Some sessions tried a global `parley` command before the required `./check`,
   adding setup noise in the isolated environment.

### Next experiment

Create a compact task-facing Parley skill that retains the syntax and repair
rules needed for ordinary programs without embedding the full package catalog.
Make the benchmark command path explicit, add regression tests for the four
missed syntax forms, and fix the list-removal backend borrow conflict. Rerun the
same matrix before expanding the sample.

## Engineering changes after 001

### 2026-07-29 — Parley 0.3.139 borrow-safe item mutation

- Changed list/map `set item` and `remove item` lowering to evaluate indexes,
  keys, and replacement values before mutably borrowing the target.
- Added emitter and native-binary regression coverage for mutations whose
  arguments read the same collection.
- Verification: 261 tests passed.
- Expected benchmark effect: remove the P901 repair turn observed in both
  Parley bracket-report runs. This expectation remains unproven until the next
  fresh-session report.

### 2026-07-29 — Parley 0.3.140 compact core skill

- Reduced the always-injected skill from 21,264 to 7,168 characters (66.3%)
  while retaining the prior exhaustive reference as an on-demand file.
- Added exact first-pass forms for typed empty lists, promptless input,
  literal braces, expression calls, conversion maybes, and direct map lookup.
- Made `./check` explicitly authoritative in isolated benchmark workspaces so
  sessions do not spend tool calls probing for a global compiler.
- Added a hard test gate keeping the core below 8,000 characters and covering
  the syntax patterns implicated by experiment 001.
- The three Parley task prompts now contain 8,615–8,659 characters, down from
  a baseline median of 22,473 characters (about 61.5%).
- Expected benchmark effect: fewer initial prompt tokens and fewer public-check
  repair turns. The next fresh-session report is the acceptance evidence.

## 002 — Compact-skill efficiency parity pilot

- Date: 2026-07-29

| Language | Hidden success | First public pass | Median checks | Median tokens | Median seconds | Repair turns |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Parley | 6/6 | 6/6 | 1.0 | 32,770.0 | 17.5059 | 0 |
| Python | 6/6 | 4/6 | 1.0 | 43,471.0 | 21.3212 | 2 |
| Rust | 6/6 | 6/6 | 1.0 | 43,249.0 | 20.0211 | 0 |

### Interpretation

Parley met the pilot acceptance gate: final correctness was preserved, median
reported tokens were 24.6% below Python and 24.2% below Rust, median elapsed
time was 17.9% below Python and 12.6% below Rust, and every Parley session
passed its first public check. Versus iteration 001, Parley's median tokens
fell 81.2%, median time fell 68.4%, and repair turns fell from 10 to 0.

The result is not uniform by task. Parley led compact ranges, was between the
baselines on bracket reporting, and trailed both baselines on inventory totals.
With only two replicates per cell, this establishes directional parity but not
a stable population estimate.

### Next experiment

Freeze Parley 0.3.140 and the current compact skill, then run 10 replicates per
task-language cell. Do not optimize against those confirmation outcomes until
the full 90-session matrix is complete. Preserve the result and report as
iteration 003.

## 003 — Ten-replicate confirmation

- Date: 2026-07-29
- Compiler: Parley 0.3.140, code/skill unchanged from iteration 002
- Agent: `gpt-5.6-sol`, medium reasoning, Codex CLI 0.142.5
- Matrix: 3 tasks × 3 languages × 10 replicates = 90 fresh sessions
- Result JSON SHA-256: `1ae43a70982986342ae893a14697e9c70c24f821d520eb72fe68b4dca5a1247f`

- Parley skill SHA-256: `2718c72f8d9644ed2b9b41cda1f9dabf1095a45dd5b6f3d52864223f80d567d6`
- Report: `benchmarks/reports/003-confirmation-gap.html`

| Language | Hidden success | First public pass | Median checks | Median tokens | Median seconds | Repair turns |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Parley | 30/30 | 23/30 | 1.0 | 33,100.0 | 21.6486 | 11 |
| Python | 30/30 | 24/30 | 1.0 | 28,711.5 | 16.0883 | 6 |
| Rust | 30/30 | 30/30 | 1.0 | 43,139.5 | 18.2593 | 0 |

### Gate result

Strict parity was **not confirmed**. Parley preserved 100% hidden success and
used 23.3% fewer median tokens than Rust, but used 15.3% more tokens than
Python and took longer than both baselines. The better-baseline gate therefore
fails.

### Diagnosed concentration

- Bracket report: Parley 8/10 first-pass, 41,027.5 median tokens; better token
  median than both baselines.
- Inventory totals: Parley 10/10 first-pass, 32,409.5 median tokens; above
  Python but below Rust.
- Compact ranges: Parley 5/10 first-pass, 66,314.5 median tokens; above both
  baselines and responsible for eight of Parley's eleven repair turns.
- The failed Parley first attempts used reserved `position` as a variable,
  command words such as `add` at the start of helper names, `changing` at call
  sites, or unparenthesized complex item/call expressions.

### Next experiment

Make one predeclared skill/compiler pass against these exact failure classes,
reduce the clean-run prompt overhead further, add direct regression coverage,
then run a new immutable matrix. Do not alter or selectively rerun iteration
003.
